"React provides a component-based structure, enabling you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

Loader: A loader is a graphical or animated element used to indicate the loading process to users when a web application's content is being loaded. This is commonly used to enhance user experience and help users understand the loading status of a page. In my project, I've added a cute bear emoji to the page. When we want to refresh the page, a 'classic' loading symbol appears."
